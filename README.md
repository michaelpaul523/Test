# zipCodeLookup
This is a webscrapping script using the Selenium module in Python 2.7
The basic idea behind the script is to search a range of addresses for a particular road in a ZIP Code
Every number in the range will be checked in the USPS ZIP Code Lookup Tool to see if it has a 4 digit add-on to the ZIP Code.
If an entered address has a 4 digit add-on, then it is in the Post Office database
